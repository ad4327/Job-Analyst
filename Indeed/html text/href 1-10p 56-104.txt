At Canva, we celebrate diversity. We deeply believe that bringing together diversity of thoughts, perspectives and expression is key to building the best product, team and company. We look for many different skills and abilities, as well as how you can enhance Canva and our culture. So, even if you don’t think you quite meet all of the skills listed or tick all the boxes, we’d still love to hear from you!
Our mission at Canva is to empower the world to design and since launching in 2013, we have grown exponentially, amassing over 75 million monthly active users across 190 different countries and a team of over 2,800 people… and the best bit is that we’ve only achieved 1% of what we know we’re capable of.
Join us and design your future.
Since Canva’s founding, our template library has been a critical and fundamental driver of our success. Fundamental to making design accessible to the world is giving people everywhere a springboard with which to create designs from. Templates are that springboard.
Templates provide inspiration to users, help them visualise what's possible and provide an approachable starting point for our users to get creative. In fact, templates are the way the majority of our users create designs so the templates teams are helping millions of people each week.
Historically, Canva’s templates have been designed by a talented team of internal graphic designers. But last year we launched Canva Creators, a platform that allows anyone to publish their templates and earn money every time they’re used. We believe Canva Creators has the potential to take Canva to the next level of scale, and we want you to be central to that growth.
In this role, you'll collaborate with our founders, Product, Finance, Strategy, Engineering and Researchers to shape the Creators Monetisation strategy.
Initially, this role will be a half of a 1-2 combination we are setting up between the Monetisation Product Manager and this role, the Data and monetisation insights Lead. Together, you will drive the strategy, modelling, shaping, testing and development of Canva Creator’s monetisation approach across templates and elements. This is an amazing opportunity to lead and grow the strategies around monetisation for Creators in an environment that rewards strategic thinking, initiative, creativity, and independence.
This role is about so much more than just “Money, money, money” - our Creators have shared stories about how becoming a Creator enabled them to gain their financial independence and make empowering decisions to put their health and happiness first, buy a new home for their family, leave a job where they were unhappy - see some of the comments below! We are building pathways to better lives for people all over the world and this role is a critical thought-leader and decision-maker as part of that.
Role Responsibilities
Forecast and model product and monetization scenarios to test likely impact of changes
Be the voice of data for the Creators team - input what data should and shouldn’t be shared and help to apply a strategic lens for how data is used across the product (including in communications outside of the product)
Analyse the feedback on the current monetisation model for Creators
Use quantitative data to inform team on who benefits from specific models and changes, and analyse how closely this aligns with Canva’s goals; and being the voice for those who are not benefiting or who are experiencing diminishing returns
Test the model with creators; work with Product to define how this should be positioned internally and externally
Present your recommendations to the team and leadership; taking ownership and recognition of your work
Continue to regularly monitor our royalty system, including analyse movements and abnormalities, and ensuring that they align continue to with Canva’s strategic direction while working with Product and Finance to make adjustments
Work with the team on researching the competitive landscape, including ensuring how we can present the most appealing opportunity for Canva Creators
Improve the lives and livelihoods of thousands of Creators (and growing!) while creating business value for Canva, on our mission to empower the world to design.
Experience You'll Need
Strong competency with SQL; experience with data warehouses such as Snowflake, Redshift, or BigQuery is a plus!
Experience wrangling and analysing data using Python or R
Extensive experience communicating with senior stakeholders
A track-record of tackling complex problems and delivering simple, elegant solutions. You hold a high-bar for elegant, strategic and scalable financial solutions
Experience with very large data sets is a huge plus, but not required
Deep understanding of how to uncover user needs through research and user empathy
Moderate execution experience so that you understand some of the intricacies of delivery
A strong sense of ethics - understanding that the decisions we make at Canva impact millions of lives, everyday
You enjoy a little flexibility in your work. Our growth means there are constantly new things to work on every day, as such it’s likely that you’ll often be working across the board on new and exciting projects.
Company Benefits
Competitive salary, plus equity options
Flexible working hours, we value work-life balance
In-house chefs that cook delicious breakfast and lunch for us each day
Free Yoga membership
Generous parental leave policy
Pet friendly offices including a garden, climbing wall, unisex toilets
Sponsored social clubs and team events
Fun and quirky celebrations
Relocation budget provided for interstate or overseas candidates
One of our core values at Canva, “Being a force for good” means we are actively working towards a world that isn't just good for a small few, but one that’s good for everyone. We believe deeply that bringing together diversity of thoughts, perspectives and expression is key for building the best product for our equally diverse community. To achieve this, we need to constantly work towards making Canva the best place to work, for everyone.

8,"Canva’s Commitment and Mission
At Canva, we celebrate diversity. We deeply believe that bringing together diversity of thoughts, perspectives and expression is key to building the best product, team and company. We look for many different skills and abilities, as well as how you can enhance Canva and our culture. So, even if you don’t think you quite meet all of the skills listed or tick all the boxes, we’d still love to hear from you!
Our mission at Canva is to empower the world to design and since launching in 2013, we have grown exponentially, amassing over 75 million monthly active users across 190 different countries and a team of over 2,800 people… and the best bit is that we’ve only achieved 1% of what we know we’re capable of.
Join us and design your future.
Since Canva’s founding, our template library has been a critical and fundamental driver of our success. Fundamental to making design accessible to the world is giving people everywhere a springboard with which to create designs from. Templates are that springboard.
Templates provide inspiration to users, help them visualise what's possible and provide an approachable starting point for our users to get creative. In fact, templates are the way the majority of our users create designs so the templates teams are helping millions of people each week.
Historically, Canva’s templates have been designed by a talented team of internal graphic designers. But last year we launched Canva Creators, a platform that allows anyone to publish their templates and earn money every time they’re used. We believe Canva Creators has the potential to take Canva to the next level of scale, and we want you to be central to that growth.
In this role, you'll collaborate with our founders, Product, Finance, Strategy, Engineering and Researchers to shape the Creators Monetisation strategy.
Initially, this role will be a half of a 1-2 combination we are setting up between the Monetisation Product Manager and this role, the Data and monetisation insights Lead. Together, you will drive the strategy, modelling, shaping, testing and development of Canva Creator’s monetisation approach across templates and elements. This is an amazing opportunity to lead and grow the strategies around monetisation for Creators in an environment that rewards strategic thinking, initiative, creativity, and independence.
This role is about so much more than just “Money, money, money” - our Creators have shared stories about how becoming a Creator enabled them to gain their financial independence and make empowering decisions to put their health and happiness first, buy a new home for their family, leave a job where they were unhappy - see some of the comments below! We are building pathways to better lives for people all over the world and this role is a critical thought-leader and decision-maker as part of that.
Role Responsibilities
Forecast and model product and monetization scenarios to test likely impact of changes
Be the voice of data for the Creators team - input what data should and shouldn’t be shared and help to apply a strategic lens for how data is used across the product (including in communications outside of the product)
Analyse the feedback on the current monetisation model for Creators
Use quantitative data to inform team on who benefits from specific models and changes, and analyse how closely this aligns with Canva’s goals; and being the voice for those who are not benefiting or who are experiencing diminishing returns
Test the model with creators; work with Product to define how this should be positioned internally and externally
Present your recommendations to the team and leadership; taking ownership and recognition of your work
Continue to regularly monitor our royalty system, including analyse movements and abnormalities, and ensuring that they align continue to with Canva’s strategic direction while working with Product and Finance to make adjustments
Work with the team on researching the competitive landscape, including ensuring how we can present the most appealing opportunity for Canva Creators
Improve the lives and livelihoods of thousands of Creators (and growing!) while creating business value for Canva, on our mission to empower the world to design.
Experience You'll Need
Strong competency with SQL; experience with data warehouses such as Snowflake, Redshift, or BigQuery is a plus!
Experience wrangling and analysing data using Python or R
Extensive experience communicating with senior stakeholders
A track-record of tackling complex problems and delivering simple, elegant solutions. You hold a high-bar for elegant, strategic and scalable financial solutions
Experience with very large data sets is a huge plus, but not required
Deep understanding of how to uncover user needs through research and user empathy
Moderate execution experience so that you understand some of the intricacies of delivery
A strong sense of ethics - understanding that the decisions we make at Canva impact millions of lives, everyday
You enjoy a little flexibility in your work. Our growth means there are constantly new things to work on every day, as such it’s likely that you’ll often be working across the board on new and exciting projects.
Company Benefits
Competitive salary, plus equity options
Flexible working hours, we value work-life balance
In-house chefs that cook delicious breakfast and lunch for us each day
Free Yoga membership
Generous parental leave policy
Pet friendly offices including a garden, climbing wall, unisex toilets

Fun and quirky celebrations
Relocation budget provided for interstate or overseas candidates
One of our core values at Canva, “Being a force for good” means we are actively working towards a world that isn't just good for a small few, but one that’s good for everyone. We believe deeply that bringing together diversity of thoughts, perspectives and expression is key for building the best product for our equally diverse community. To achieve this, we need to constantly work towards making Canva the best place to work, for everyone.
