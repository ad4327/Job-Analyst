About ACLEI

The Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI) is an independent agency within the Attorney-General’s Portfolio, established to support the Integrity Commissioner in carrying out his or her responsibilities for detecting, investigating and preventing corrupt conduct in Australian Government agencies with law enforcement functions. The Integrity Commissioner has extensive powers, including the ability to hold coercive hearings, and ACLEI investigative staff are able to use a range of law enforcement powers to assist in the Integrity Commissioner’s investigations.

At ACLEI, we seek the very best. Attracting and supporting clever, innovative and committed people is essential to ensure ACLEI is well placed to undertake its critical work. We work in a complex and dynamic setting where exceptional judgement and an ability to achieve results are critical.

ACLEI is currently undergoing a process of organisational transformation to ensure we remain fit for purpose in an increasingly complex operating environment. In support of our transformation strategy, we are looking for outstanding individuals with the ability to lead, manage, cooperate and perform successfully across a wide range of corporate and operational functions.

Reporting to the Senior Data Analyst, the Data Analyst will assist with the production of strategic intelligence insights by ACLEI’s Strategic Intelligence and Data Analysis (SIDA) team.

The role would suit either an intelligence analyst with an affinity for information technology and data, or a data analyst with experience of, or interest in, intelligence practice.

Working as part of a multi-disciplinary team of strategic intelligence analysts and data analysts, the Data Analyst not only extracts, cleanses, manipulates and analyses corruption-related data, but also recognises the most effective means of presenting that data to a broad and varied client base. The Data Analyst is also responsible for:
Working with data across multiple technologies to unlock insights, and inform management and operational decision making.
Educate and inform ACLEI staff on the appropriate use of data, assisting to increase the overall data literacy and maturity of the agency.
Assist with remediating historical data sources, and with the migration of data to new systems and databases.

With industry knowledge and an innovative approach, Adam and Matthew set about defining what allied health services can be when quality and person-centred care is placed before all else in healthcare.

The partnership, that merged clinical expertise with business acumen, soon established Empower Healthcare as a leading provider of quality services in residential aged care facilities in Victoria. This success fuelled the expansion of our services within residential aged care, home care and NDIS.

Edinburgh - SA, Fairbairn - ACT, Fishermans Bend - VIC
The Role
The Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) is offering two permanent positions as an Advanced Technology Foresight Analyst.
You will develop a sound understanding of a broad range of technologies, including current technologies and those that may be developed in the future. You will work with planners and operations analysts to foresee how these technologies might strengthen or weaken Australia’s national interests.

One position, located in Canberra, will focus on national security and the way it may operate in the future, including foreseeing disruptions or entirely new concepts of operations. The other position, located in Melbourne will focus on Defence capabilities, including foreseeing disruptions or entirely new capabilities. Although the positions are based in Canberra and Melbourne, we are open to the idea of having our candidate work from Edinburgh, SA.

The role involves desk-based technical research and analysis as part of a large team responsible for providing emerging technology and foresight advice to Defence and other government departments. You will be responsible for a technical area that corresponds to your current S&T skills, and will broaden your expertise into a range of fields relevant to Defence (for example AI, cyber, biotechnology, quantum and many others).

You will be trained in role-specific analytic skills, including data analytics and foresight techniques. You will develop a deep understanding of the structure and decision-making processes of the Defence Department, to ensure your advice is tailored to have an impact. You will develop into a communications expert, able to concisely explain technical issues to busy, non-technical stakeholders. Outputs will include written reports, verbal briefings, multi-media and infographics. The role requires building networks across our own team of experts, as well as broader DSTG, Defence and intelligence.

About our Team
The technology analyst team is a part of the Defence Impacts of Emerging Technology (DIET) Group, within Strategy and Joint Force (SJF) Major Science and Technology Capability (MSTC), which is itself within the Joint and Operations Analysis Division of the Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG).

This team is organised under DSTG’s Strategic Futures Project, and works closely with the Critical Technology Foresight (CTF) Group. You will be joining a project team of approximately 25 staff, including technology analysts (like this position), experts in tools and methods (such as AI experts who write programs to assist the analysts) and social scientists (who evaluate the impact of technology on society).

The Strategic Futures Project is a centre of gravity within government for emerging technology and foresight advice. Our advice feeds into decision-making, such as for senior Defence committees, the Department’s S&T portfolio planning and capability planning for the ADF. We play a key role in whole-of-government decision-making via our strong linkages to the Critical Technology Policy Coordination Office in PM&C. We partner with DSTG’s 2000 experts, across Defence, policy and intelligence agencies, and with international experts.

Our team is passionate, professional, welcoming and inclusive.

Our Ideal Candidate
We are seeking an Australian citizen who is naturally curious and motivated to develop broad expertise across diverse emerging technologies. Candidates from all S&T disciplines will be considered, but we especially seek experts in the physical sciences, engineering or systems analysis. We seek science-communicators who are passionate about making an impact for the nation. Ideally you will have experience in the APS, or have been responsible for leading and delivering projects in academia or industry. A pre-existing interest in Defence is not required, but you must be open to developing this.

S&T 5 level jobs are typically suitable for mid-career professionals rather than entry level jobs for graduates. You will have no formal responsibilities for supervising staff, but you will be expected to show leadership and take responsibility for driving outcomes and enhancing the capabilities of our team.

A PhD or equivalent qualifications/experience is required."
