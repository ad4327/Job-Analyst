Job Description & Summary
About the Opportunity
At PwC, you’ll help Australian businesses, governments and not-for-profit companies create value and improve the way they work. From digitising healthcare, to creating smarter cities or driving innovation with our clients, together we build trust in society and solve important problems.
Integrated Infrastructure brings this to life by helping clients improve the way they operate, reduce costs, manage risks, leverage talent, or fundamentally change the way they do business. Your work here will help organisations of all shapes and sizes work smarter and grow faster.
Within PwC’s Integrated Infrastructure team in Adelaide as a Senior Associate you will work collaboratively with our broader Integrated Infrastructure teams on important client projects, or sometimes directly with clients on more specialist or technical analytics based assignments.
As a Senior Associate in our Analytics team your impact will be seen by:
Working with the Partners, our team leaders and broader Consulting teams on projects to establish and build trusted relationships with client executives, management and delivery teams
Helping design, build and deliver innovative analytics-backed solutions primarily for our large Federal, State and Local Government and Public Sector clients, also working on projects for our wider clients from other industry sectors, working as a team to drive propositions around customer centricity, productivity, supply chain, workforce, environment, infrastructure and cities
Using your experience in programming languages such as Java and Python to drive advanced analytics projects in areas such as simulation, optimisation, and AI/ML
Using your experience and understanding with cloud computing to implement scalable solutions
About you
You will most likely have a background and a track record of success in working in teams with clients to deliver solutions backed by analytics.
You are likely to have 4-5+ years of experience applying advanced analytics, database development and data visualisation to complex issues.
You will have a quantitative background with a qualification in mathematics, statistics, business intelligence, engineering or similar. You will need to have excellent analytical and problem solving skills, as well as being able to communicate effectively and impactfully with clients and stakeholders. Proficiency in some of the following toolsets is required – Microsoft Excel, SAS, SQL, R, Python, Alteryx, PowerBI, Qlik, Tableau.
You are agile, people-focused, motivated to succeed, analytically minded and commercially astute. You have strong attention to detail and exceptional standards in quality.
Passionate about being at the forefront of change, you’re ready to help our Integrated Infrastructure team deliver practical advice that speaks straight to the heart of client business issues and deliver innovative results. You’re collaborative and enjoy working in an innovative environment. You’re a problem solver by nature and want to join a firm that values the kind of people who reimagine the possible for their clients and stakeholders. Most importantly, you act with integrity and show care for the people you work with.
Please note the techniques and technologies listed are examples only and are not intended to be exhaustive or all required.
Much of our work in the Integrated Infrastructure business is State Government, but we also work more widely with both the Federal and Local Government sector clients, so experience in these sectors will also be relevant. We have particular interest in experience in transport, planning, infrastructure, health and customer service related departments, other relevant broader experience is also of interest and welcome.
